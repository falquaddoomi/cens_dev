Hi, this is the dev branch of the main CENS JCCC project.

The project has a few important dependencies, some of which I haven't
added to the project yet (namely, the clickatell, jabber, and working irc
backends for rapidsms). I haven't added them yet because I'm not sure
how to package them along with the site in a sensible way, but once I figure
that out I'll put them up here, too.

Anyhow, the dependencies that you *can* resolve on your own are:
- Django 1.3
- South 0.7.2
- Twisted and Wokkel (will check the versions shortly)
- django-dbtemplates

Before you attempt to run the project, be sure to edit the "settings.sample.py"
file appropriately and copy it renamed to the same directory as "settings.py".
You'll likely need to change the paths for logging, since right now they're
local to my machine (will look into fixing that).

There are three components which you must initiate to start the system:
1) the scheduler, invoked via ./manage.py scheduler <port>
2) the router, invoked via ./manage.py runrouter
3) the web interface, invoked via ./manage.py runserver <address>:<port>

You can still run any component independently, but they will of course
be unable to attend to their responsibilities unless they're running.
Specifically, no tasks will be executed if the scheduler isn't running,
and no messages can be received/sent if the router isn't running. The
webserver is non-essential to the execution of the system, but is
helpful for determing what it's doing. :)

The main administrative interface for tasks is located at
http://<server-ip>:<port>/taskmanager/

Do let me know if you run into any problems. Keep in mind that this
is for internal development mostly, so a lot of it may not make sense. Still,
you're welcome to hack away at it if you like. :)
